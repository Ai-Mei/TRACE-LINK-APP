# TrackrBee
This project is a simple contact-tracing app written in Python language. This app will prompt the user to input their information. Then, the inputs will be saved and stored. The app will also have a "search" function where users can search for any keyword. The app will then show the information with the searched word.

>I created this Python program because of two reasons. First, this project is a university requirement. The second and last reason, I wrote this program is to learn and explore more in the field of programming.
Project Description
This program asks the user for 2 input numbers (in order). Then the program will ask for an operation to perform on the input numbers and outputs the answer. In case of invalid input from the user, the program will print a message and will ask for the necessary input until the user types in the appropriate input. After the initial process is done, the program will ask the user if they need to use the calculator again, if yes, the program will start again and if no, the program is done.
